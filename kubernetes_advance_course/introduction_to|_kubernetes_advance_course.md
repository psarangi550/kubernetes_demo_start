# Introduction to the "Kubernetes Advanced Section"

- the `first section` considered on the `building the basic but functional microservice-architecture` hence included the `topic that are necessary` in that 

- there are few `kubernetes topic` that we have missed , its time now to `go through those kubernetes topic` which is `kubernetes Advance topics`

- here we will be learning about `topic` as a part of the `Kubernetes Advance Topic`
  
  - `Requests and Limits`
  
  - `Horizonal POD scaling (HPA)`
  
  - `Liveness and Readiness Probes`
  
  - `Role Based Access Control(RBAC)`
  
  - `configMaps/Secrets`
  
  - `ingress control`
  
  - `Jobs/DaemonSets and StatefuleSets and other workloads`
  
  - `CI/CD`

- in most of the `topics` are `cpovered with minikube` , but for `some of the topics` such as `RBAC(Role Based Access Control)` that relay on the `professional cluster`

- in `RBAC` we will be `switching between the user` which will be easy with the `professional cluster`

- in the `Ingress control` we will be seeing how to `deploy the ingress controller` to `AWS` , but the `main part of the ingress is runnable in minikube as well`

- couple of topics `are out of scope` , hence we will be seeing the `How to Set up the HTTPS link` , `youtube link been provided`
