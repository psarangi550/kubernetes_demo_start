# Viewing Metrics on the Dashboard in kubernetes

- preveiously we have the `kubectl top pod` and `kubectl top node` command which provide the `actual resource used by each POD container or cluster`

- here we are using the `commandline output of the actual resource used by each POD container or cluster` using the `metrics-server`

- but if we want then we can setup `light weight very basic metrics dashboard` so that `we can see a graphical user interface for the metrics output`

- which is a `light weight and very basic implementation of the monitoring system`

- `light weight very basic metrics dashboard` not so `sophesticated as the prometheus` where we can `set up` the `Alarm` , but it is `useful`

- there is `dashboard` build into `kubernetes` , which is `another minikube addon`

- here we can see all the `minikube addons` by using the command as below 

    ```bash
        minikube addons list
        # this will list out all the addons available inside the minikube kubernetes cluster
        # here hence we will get the response as below

        ðŸŒŸ  The 'dashboard' addon is enabled

    ```

- we can see the `POD` spunned inside the `kubernetes-dashboard namespace` as below

- here we will getting additional `POD and Deployment and Service` added onto the `kubernetes-dashboard namespace` while we install the `dashboard minikube addon`

    ```bash

    ```

- the `kubernetes-dashboard` is a `Browser Based Application`

- we can goto the `kubernetes-dashboard` service definition and `edit the kubernetes-dashboard Service` to allocate a `NodePort Service Type` with a `allocated port i.e > 30000`

- but there is a `easier way available` in order to access the `kubernetes dashboard` by using the `minikube dashboard` command

- we can run the `minikube dashboard command as below`

    
    ```bash
        minikube dashboard
        # here we are using the minikube dashboard command in order to access the kubernetes dashboard
        # when we execute this command this will provide the outout as below
        # this command will automatically fire up a Browser
        # but the it will going to open in localhost port of the host system rather than minikube IP with port

        # imp
        # the complexity over here is because we don't have to create any Kubernetes Service
        # as we know the kubernetes-dashboard is a ClusterIP Service hence can't be accessed outside the kubernetes cluster
        # here minikube will going to use a "Kubernetes Service" called `proxy`
        # which is a "mini web-server" which will run on the "host machine" which is not inside the "minikube kubernetes cluster"
        # when the traffic comes to the localhost of the host system then  redirect the traffic will forwarded to the kubernetes-dashboard service in this case
        # this is a quick and dirty way of accessing the Service even though they are working as ClusterIP inside the kubernetes cluster


        # here even we do a `ctrl+c` then we would think that that will stop the `kubernetes Service` i.e `proxy`
        # with which we will be unable to access the kubernetes-dashboard
        # but that will not going to happen when we use this command
        # even though we will be doing the "ctrl+c" thenm also we can ablew to access the "kubernetes dashboard"



    ```

- the `kubernetes dashboard` which got open due to the `minikube dashboard` command is not `paticularly very useful`

- but we can perform `any action` that we performed inside the `kubernetes-dashboard browser` that we are doing using the `kubectl command`

- we can perform action such as 
  
  - we can launch `New POD`
  
  - we can change the `Deployment`
  
  - anything that we are doing using the `kubectl` command

- we can goto the `kubernetes-dashboard` &rarr; `Deployments` &rarr; `select the Deployment` &rarr; `Scale Up the Deployment` as below

- ![alt text](image-1.png)  

- we can goto the `kubernetes-dashboard` &rarr; `Deployments` &rarr; `select the Deployment` &rarr; here we can see the `replicaset info` and `POD info` and `name of image that been used` &rarr; `click on the POD` then we can goto the `logs of the POD` as below 

- ![alt text](image-2.png)

- ![alt text](image-3.png)

- if we want to `perform` action with the `graphical User Interface` rather than using the `kubectl commandline` this could be the `tool that can be used`

- when we run in the `prodcution cluster` everything run through the `files` that we `checked into the  Source Control such as github/gitlab`

- then it will handed to the `CICD pipeline` such as `jenkins/azure Pipeline` to `perform all sort of action`  

- here we can get the `actual usage by the cluster Nodes` by `clicking on the Node inside the Cluster` inside the `kubernetes dashboard` showing the `actual resource usage` using the `CPU usage or memory Usage`

- ![alt text](image-4.png)

- this `feature` been `recently updated`

- if we goto the `kubernetes github issue page` as [kubernetes github Issue Page](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2986) then we can see the `Issue is now closed`

- if we goto the `corresponding pull request`  on [kubernetes github pull request](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3504) we can see that `thats now approved` and `implemented`

- but if we are using the `preveious version of the kubernetes` if the `metrics-server kubernetes-dashboard` implementation not done then we will be unable to see the `actual resource usage` inside `clicking on the Node inside the Cluster`

- if we are `using the old kubernetes version` and `unable to get the CPU and Memory Graph on metrics-server kubernetes-dashboard` then we can use the `additional addon called heapster`

- here the `metrics-server service` is a `replacement` for the `heapster service` which `is now` been `depricated and removed`

- so when we try to use the `minikube addons enable heapster` it will be pointing to the `metrics-server addon`

    ```bash
        minikube addons enable heapster
        # here if we try to enable the heapster minikube kubernetes addon then 
        âŒ›  using metrics-server addon, heapster is deprecated

- the `default url of the metrics-server` which will be pointing to the `workloads` which will show the `resource usage` for the `default namespace` such as `POD resource usage`

- but if we goto the `Nodes`  and check the `resource` usage which been provided for `all the namespaces`

- hence we might seen a `surge in CPU and memory usage` using the `Nodes` as it include `all the namesapce suchas kube-public and kube-system and kubernetes-dashboard` etc

- here we can goto `individual POD` in order to see the `resource usage` i.e `CPU and Memory usage` for the `POD container`

- we will be not getting the `grafana and influxdb` while using the `metrics-server` addons

- but if we are using the `heapster` then it will come along with the `default implementation of grafana and influx DB`  

- **How to Delete the Minikube Kubernetes Cluster**

- we can delete the `minikube local kubernetes cluster` then we can use it as below 

- here we can use the command as 

    ```bash
        minikube delete
        # this will remove the minikube kubernetes cluster
        # the below will be response for the same
        Deleting local kubernetes cluster
        Machine Deleted 
        
        rm -rf ~/.kube
        # here we are removing the kube config folder in this case

        rm -rf ~/.minikube
        # here we are removing the minikube config folder in this case

    ```

- **How to disable the yaml file so that `kubectl apply/create` command will not be picking it up**

- we can mention the `yaml definition` file as `*.yml.disabled` then this will be `disables` the `kubectl apply` command will not `pick that up`
